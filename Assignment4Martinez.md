# WEEK 5 ASSIGNMENT

## Activity 1
* You will see the branch at the bottom of the window, but you can also use the CLI, to see the local and remote branches. Is there a remote branch created yet?\

![Creating New Branch](./Images/Create_feature_branch.png)\

At this point I've only created a branch in my local repository. I have to publish the new branch to the remote repository to really create that remote branch.

* What is different when you run git branch and git branch -r?\
git branch shows only your local branches whereas git branch -r shows only remote-tracking branches.
